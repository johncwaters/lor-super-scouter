Since there is a low amount of data and we want to keep costs low, avoid online DB entirely
Store records for players in local storage in JSON and update as needed

// Grab games and extract data
// Update the players specific JSON file with updated information
    // To avoid duplicate games being recorded, this can be done on a quick schedule

// PROBLEMS:
    // How to avoid having to call each individual player card each time a leadboard needs loaded
    // Solution?: store a master file that includes everyone? This gets updated each 'loop' update is done on the player cards 

// EXAMPLE
data = {
    owner: {
        owner_comb: "Otzo NA1 Americas", //partition key

        //player info
        owner_name: "Otzo",
