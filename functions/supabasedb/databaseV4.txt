Supabase provides unlimited API calls for querying data with a limited amount of storage
This allows us to use it without worrying about running up a bill
Downside is the limited amount of storage which will require a flush often

// EXAMPLE
match_history = { //table
        id: 1,
        created_at: "timestamp",
        owner_comb: "Otzo NA1 Americas", // key

        //player info
        owner_name: "Otzo",
        owner_tag: "NA1",
        owner_puuid: "aoijhsdiohpjh...",
        owner_region: "Americas",

        //game info
        game_start_time_utc: "2022-07-30:39:41.7704820+00:00",
        game_mode: "Constructed", //bo3?
        game_type: "Ranked", //seasonal?
        game_result: "win",

        //deck
        deck_code: "aoisdjghoair...", //sort deck code alphabetically for consistency 
        deck_region_one: "faction_Demacia_Name",
        deck_region_two: "faction_Shurima_Name",

    }
